## Introduction
The Iris Classification Project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on the length and width of their sepals and petals.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with 4 features each:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and run the `iris_classification.py` script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Soham-003/IRIS-Classification-Project.git
cd IRIS-Classification-Project
python iris_classification.py
```

## Algorithms Used
- Random Forest Classifier


## Results
The results of the classification algorithm is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
